I'm getting off WordPress!

For a while, I thought I would pair my existing WordPress setup with a custom Gatsby site. Then, I was interested in other CMS options — namely Sanity.io. Now, I'm really attracted to the idea of using just Markdown and having the text for my blog posts alongside the code that makes up the frontend of my site.

The official Gatsby tutorial was quite inspiring for me! 🟣✏️🤩

Some of the things I might eventually write about on my blog include:

- Web development
- Motocross
- Health & fitness
- Productivity
- IndyCar and other motor sports
