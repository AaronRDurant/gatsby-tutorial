I'm getting off WordPress!

For a while, I thought I would pair my existing WordPress setup with a custom Gatsby site. Then, I was interested in other CMS options — namely Sanity.io. Now, I'm really into the idea of using just Markdown and having my blog content alongside the code that makes up my site's frontend. 🟣✏️🤩

Some of the things I might eventually write about:

- Web development
- Motocross
- Health & fitness
- Productivity
- IndyCar and other motor sports
